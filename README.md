1. Imports
The code imports the requests library for making HTTP requests, random for selecting a user-agent randomly, and re for regular expressions to find URLs.

2. Scraper Function
Input Parameter: The Scraper function accepts a query string (default is "Drugs").
URL Preparation: It replaces spaces in the query with "+" to format the search URL properly.
User-Agent Selection: A random user-agent string is chosen from a predefined list to mimic different browsers and reduce the chance of being blocked.

3. Making the Request
The code constructs the search URL for Ahmia and sends a GET request using the randomly selected user-agent.
Error Handling: If the request fails (e.g., due to a network issue), an error message is printed.

4. Response Handling
If the request is successful, the response text (HTML content) is passed to the findlinks function.

5. Finding Links
Regular Expression: The findlinks function uses a regex pattern to search for .onion URLs in the HTML content.
Unique Links: It removes duplicate links by converting the list to a set and back to a list.
File Saving: If links are found, they are saved to a text file with a randomly generated filename.

6. Output
The code prints messages indicating the status of the request and the file-saving process, providing feedback on what it has done
